## uchifinals - your uchicago final schedule, better
A final exam scheduler for undergraduate University of Chicago students.

**Intuitive search system** - uchifinals has an intuitive and expansive search system that allows students to search for their exams using different criteria, such as course name, instructor, exam date, exam location.

**Easily export schedule to calendar** - uchifinals allows students to export any exam to their Google/Apple/Outlook calendar with the click of a button, removing the need to manually create events for final exams.

**Replaces an inconvenient system** - each quarter the UChicago registrar sends out final exams in an inconvenient and barely readable excel sheet, uchifinals can completely replace it and make the UChicago experience just a bit easier.
